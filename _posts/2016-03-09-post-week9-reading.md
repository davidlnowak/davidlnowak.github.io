I approach this topic of game play with a sense of trepidation.  Not because of the subject matter of some of these—though my wife is now questioning what I my PhD will be in—but because I have never been good at playing games.  When my sons were young, I remember playing Tekken—a fighting game-- with them on the Play Station.  I always chose to be one of the scantily clothed, buxom babe characters in the game; they always beat me.  

I first tried Stick Shift.  I didn’t know what the hell I was doing—and I drive a stick shift.  So, I got wrapped up in the guy’s goofy face and wasn’t paying attention to anything else, at first.  Then I noticed that he was dozing off.  I figured out how to move the mouse to shift, but the first time I tried I stalled the car.  I got it going again and was able to shift.  I found moving the mouse in different directions moves the dude’s head back and forth.  I found the up and down motion on the stick shift—something I’m not used to doing in my real car.  I got it into 5th gear and then the damn police rolled up behind me.  

So, I’m sitting there—stopped by the cops.  Now, there’s a timer on the screen, and every time I click the mouse my character blows a kiss to the officers—and another 10 minutes gets added to the timer.  I exited the game, restarted it and it remembers the place I left off with the timer still counting down.

So, I’m at a point where I just don’t understand.  I just don’t get it.  Perhaps, this is my issue with playing games is that I either always lose, get killed, can’t get past a certain stage, or can’t figure the damn thing out.
